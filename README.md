# Reweave

Reweave is a word-grid puzzle game inspired by Word Hunt-style adjacency rules. A puzzle gives the player a required word list and a partially empty board. The goal is to reconstruct a board of letters that can spell every required word by tracing adjacent tiles.

Players can create their own puzzles, remove selected letters to set the starting challenge, share the generated puzzle ID, and then play the puzzle through the browser.

## Gameplay

Each puzzle has two board states:

- `answer`: the solved board, containing the full intended layout.
- `letters`: the starting board shown to the player, where some answer letters may be replaced with blanks.

Words are found by walking from tile to adjacent tile, including diagonals, without reusing the same tile in one word. Blank cells and holes do not contribute letters. The puzzle is complete when every required word is found and no extra words are present.

The create flow lets a puzzle author:

- Choose a board size.
- Fill letters and holes on the answer board.
- Generate the complete word list from the board.
- Lock the word list, then hide selected letters to create the starting board.
- Submit the puzzle and receive a play link.

The play flow lets a player:

- Load a puzzle by ID.
- Fill blanks while fixed starting letters stay locked.
- Track found, missing, and extra words live.
- Reveal a selected tile, a random tile, or the full solution if needed.
- Click words to view dictionary definitions and pronunciation data.

## Tech Stack

Core game logic is written in Rust and shared between the backend and frontend.

- Rust workspace with shared logic in the `reweave` crate.
- React 19 and Vite for the browser UI.
- React Compiler enabled through `@vitejs/plugin-react` and `reactCompilerPreset()`.
- WebAssembly generated with `wasm-pack` so the frontend can run Rust board and word-checking logic locally.
- Vercel serverless Rust functions for puzzle creation and loading.
- PostgreSQL via `sqlx` for persisted puzzles.
- Optional local JSON-file storage through `USE_LOCAL_FILES` for backend development.
- `pnpm` for frontend package management.

```

The Rust workspace includes `reweave` and `frontend`. The `wordlist` crate is intentionally excluded because it is a standalone generator that depends on local, gitignored source files.

## API Shape

The backend is deployed separately from the frontend under `reweave/`.

- `POST /api/create` accepts `name`, `width`, `height`, `letters`, `words`, and `answer`, then returns `{ "id": string }` or `{ "error": string }`.
- `GET /api/puzzle?puzzle_id=<id>` loads a puzzle by ID.
- `GET /api/puzzle/:puzzle_id` is also supported by the backend Vercel rewrite and fallback path parsing.

The database expects a `puzzles` table with these fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `width`
- `height`
- `letters`
- `words`
- `answer`

There are currently no SQL migrations in the repo.

## Frontend Data Model

The frontend uses discriminated word-list types:

- `CreateWords`: `{ kind: "create", all }`
- `PlayWords`: `{ kind: "play", found, missing, extra }`

The generated WASM typing for `check` returns `any`, so frontend page boundaries cast that value into `PlayWords` rather than passing `any` through component props.

## Word List

The playable dictionary is embedded into the frontend WASM crate with `include_str!("../../wordlist/wordlist.txt")`. If the dictionary changes, rebuild the WASM package before building or deploying the frontend.

The `wordlist/` generator starts from the 2024 Collins Scrabble Word list and filters it with a local blacklist. Its source inputs, `CSW24.txt` and `blacklist.txt`, are gitignored.

## Development

The frontend and backend are run separately during local development. The frontend Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:3000`, so the backend should be running there when testing create/play API calls locally.

### Frontend

Install frontend dependencies from the repo root:

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend install
```

Build the WASM package:

```sh
wasm-pack build frontend --target bundler --out-dir pkg
```

Run the frontend dev server:

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend run dev
```

### Backend

The backend is built around Vercel serverless functions and is usually run locally with the Vercel CLI from `reweave/`:

```sh
cd reweave
USE_LOCAL_FILES=1 vc dev
```

or:

```sh
cd reweave
USE_LOCAL_FILES=1 vercel dev
```

`USE_LOCAL_FILES=1` lets contributors run the backend without access to the production database or this project's Vercel environment variables. In this mode, puzzles are read from and written to `../puzzles/*.json` relative to the backend process, so create a repo-root `puzzles/` directory before creating puzzles locally:

```sh
mkdir puzzles
```

In local-file mode, created puzzle IDs are based on the puzzle name because the filename is `../puzzles/<name>.json`.

Someone running the backend this way should not need access to the production Vercel project, but the Vercel CLI may still ask them to log in and link or create their own local Vercel project.

To use database-backed storage instead, omit `USE_LOCAL_FILES` and provide `DATABASE_URL`. The database must already have a compatible `puzzles` table; this repo does not currently include migrations.

### Build And Checks

Build the frontend against the current generated WASM package:

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend run build
```

Build the frontend the same way deployment does:

```sh
wasm-pack build frontend --target bundler --out-dir pkg && pnpm --dir frontend run build
```

Run common checks:

```sh
pnpm --dir frontend run lint
cargo test -p reweave
cargo check -p frontend --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo fmt --check
```

## Environment

The frontend reads `VITE_API_URL` as its API base URL. If it is unset, requests use same-origin `/api`; Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:3000` during local frontend development.

The backend requires `DATABASE_URL` unless `USE_LOCAL_FILES` is set. With `USE_LOCAL_FILES`, puzzles are read and written under `../puzzles/` relative to the backend process.

## Deploy

The root `vercel.json` deploys the frontend. It installs the Rust WASM target, installs `wasm-pack`, installs global `pnpm@9`, builds the WASM package, and outputs `frontend/dist`.

The backend has its own `reweave/vercel.json` and is deployed separately from `reweave/`. It includes CORS headers for `/api/(.*)` and rewrites `/api/puzzle/:puzzle_id` to `/api/puzzle?puzzle_id=:puzzle_id`.
