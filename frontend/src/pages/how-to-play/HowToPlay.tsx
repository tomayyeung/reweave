            Pick a puzzle from the puzzle list. A board might open with some
            starting letters already placed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Starting letters are fixed. You cannot change or clear them while
            playing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click an empty square to select it, then type a letter. Press
            Backspace to clear a letter you added.
          </li>
          <li>
            There may be holes in the board. They are not playable tiles and
            letters cannot be placed in them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the word list while you solve. Found words in green are already
            on the board, missing words in red still need to be made, and extra
            words in gray are words your current board creates that are not part
            of the puzzle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Solve the puzzle by creating all required words, without any extras.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <li>
            Set the width and height, then update the size. Do this at the
            start, as changing the size clears the current board.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click tiles and type letters to build the solved board. This is the
            answer players are trying to reconstruct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Space on an empty tile to toggle a hole. Holes have a dotted
            outilne and become unusable spaces in the puzzle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check the generated word list. Adjust letters and holes until the
            list contains the words you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lock the word list when the answer is ready. This switches the board
            into clue selection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Backspace on letters to toggle whether they are shown as
            starting clues or hidden from players. Hidden letters are grayed
            out, while given letters are bolded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter a puzzle name and submit it with an optional description. Use
            the generated play link to share your puzzle with your friends!
